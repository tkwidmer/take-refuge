Teagan fell in love with bootblacking at a young age, doing her shoes before church. Although these days her skills are being put to more salacious uses, she still identifies as a spiritual bootblack. For her, the act of bootblacking harkens back to the foot-washing ritual. She is honored to provide a humble service to her community. As a bootblack, Teagan loves the exchange of energy and the intimate connection that the stand creates. She views herself as a healer, seeking to clean both the leather and it's owner during their time in her stand. Teagan firmly believes that the bootblack stand is a sanctuary for those in need. Wether she's working a stand, or sitting for other bootblacks - that's the feeling she chases.

Teagan is an individual director for the Bay Area Leather Alliance Board. Over the past three years she's been the stage manager for the Mr San Francisco Leather contest. In 2018, in conjunction with the Leather Alliance she produced the first ever San Francisco Bootblack contest.

Teagan is International Ms Bootblack 2018, and the 20th person to hold that title. She is also Southwest Bootblack 2017 and Southern California Bootblack 2016. She is based in Oakland, CA. During her title years she has invited our community to "Take Refuge" in the capable hands of our bootblacks.
