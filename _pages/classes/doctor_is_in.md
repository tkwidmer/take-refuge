#### The Doctor Is In: Spiritual Leather Care

People take care of leather for many different reasons. For some, it’s a manifestation of our kinky sexuality. For others it’s a chance to explore the technical prowess. For yet others, it’s an a time for introspective meditation. Personally, I consider myself to be a spiritual bootblack and a healer. Because leather lasts so long it bears witness to our greatest moments of joy, but it also is with us during our periods of deepest sorrow. As a bootblack when take care of leather, i’m also taking care of the person who wears that leather.
