## Gear Up: Leather as Political Resistance

#### Description
Leather protects us. Both emotionally and physically. Leather is our armor.
Join this class which is part lecture and part facilitated discussion by Teagan about
the history of political activism in the leather community as well what we can do
as a community to make a difference during the dark times ahead. The personal is political
once again as our lives and our desires are politicized. As we look ahead toward
uncertain times, we will resource share about what we are doing to #resist. Let's take lessons from
our history. It was leather women who showed up to take care of gay men dying of AIDS. Whether
it's marching in the streets, fundraising for valuable non-profits, or providing support
at home your voice and presence is needed in the resistance.
