## Leather Lust

Co-taught by Jesbian, International Little Miss Little 2014

#### Description
Welcome to the world of Leather and Boot Worship, lets start with the basics! It's flirty, it's fun and OMG is it hot...
If you plan it right a leather worship scene can provide some of the most intimate moments for you and your partner. We will be going through a few things to consider when doing leather and boot worship including safety precautions, boot anatomy, and some techniques to foster connection between you and your partner. Then the fun begins with a few hot demos: garments, oil tans, and high shines... oh my! As always, questions and discussions are welcomed throughout the class! Bring your person and their boots too as there will be a chance for you to try out some of the techniques you have learned. There is no one true way to worship leather ... except to have fun!

#### Bio

Teagan is International Ms Bootblack 2018. She is also Southwest Bootblack 2017 and Southern California Bootblack 2016.
