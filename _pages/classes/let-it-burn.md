## Let it Burn: Cell Popping and Micro Strike Branding

Co-taught by Jesbian, International Little Miss Little 2014

#### Description

Do you like the distinctive smell of burning flesh? Does the sound of the sizzle hot metal makes when it touches skin make you shiver? Make no mistake, this is not for the feint of heart. But for those who are not afraid of getting burned - this intimate play can be life changing. We’ll talk about the history of cell popping and branding, some safety tips to keep in mind, and then we’ll get down to the nuts and bolts with a demo of how you can combine branding and ritual to create a powerful experience. There will be time for questions. At the end of this class we will cover a few aftercare tips and trips for the recovery path.
