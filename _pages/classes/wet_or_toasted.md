## Wet Or Toasted, But Always Eat My Ash

Co-taught by Jesbian, International Little Miss Little 2014

#### Description
The Ritual and Etiquette of Cigar Preparation and Play. We will guide the class through a technical explanation of cigar service and a how-to on playing safely with cigars. This class will be interactive with time for your questions. Donâ€™t forget the steaming hot demos. We will demonstrate proper active cigar service and presentation. Then we will show some different forms of cigar play. This will include how you can mix cigar play with other forms of play including breathplay (hands, gasmasks, etc) and boot worship. This class is aimed to get your play on the edge and very intimate. Not for the first time player but a tasty introduction to cigars and how to add them to your toybox.
