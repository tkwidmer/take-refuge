I want to share something with you. Something that I hope inspires some of you.

I haven't been publicly bootblacking for all that long. In fact the first time I publicly worked a stand was three years ago today. When I put it that way, it's pretty hard to believe where I stand today, holding the title of International Ms Bootblack 2018.

I share this for a few reasons:

#### I did not do this alone

I soaked in information and skill from everyone around me. For about 3 months, 3-6 hours a weekend, I sat next to IMBB 2014 Scout while he worked the eagle. I had sat with him sporaticly before that. In April of 2015 I had come to scout and said, "I want to work a stand." Scout told me: "Come sit and watch me." It was actually Scout who planted the title bug in me. He said: "I think you could do this thing." He saw a talent and he encouraged it. We never had a formal mentorship. But I learned so much just watching him work.

I've picked up techniques from every single Bootblack I've watched, worked next to, or sat for. If I were to name them it would take a while. It's one of the things I love about bootblacking. There is always something new to learn. And bootblack's are happy and passionate to share about their love of doing boots. Our community by nature is a teaching and sharing community. Our community is one of constant and ongoing informal mentorship.

I say this because right now there are baby Bootblack's who have only done their own leathers who have the talent and the drive to achieve great things. Maybe they have done a a pair of boots for a friend. Maybe they are too scared to work a public stand, but there is a secret desire somewhere inside of them. Mentorship doesn't have to be a formal serious relationship. Mentorship is sometimes casual encouragement. Mentorship is sometimes being a positive force in the community just by working your stand and letting people in. It takes 0 extra energy or effort to make a difference.

Find those who are hungry for knowledge. Encourage them. Imagine what they can accomplish.

#### Being an acomplished bootblack wont win titles

I am a good Bootblack but being the MOST accomplished Bootblack is not what wins competitions. I am not a master bootblack. Personally, I reserve that for people who have done this every day. We have some amazing people in this community who have bootblacked or done leather care for a living at various points in their life.

This is a hobby for me. I love it. And I'm serviceable at it. I give a pretty great barshine and and ok spit shine. I don't really do restoration. And that's ok. Sometimes this community can be very critical. But in general I think that does more harm than good. Occasionally there is someone whose skills are just not up to par or they have chosen an unacceptable product. ("An acceptable range of products, and an acceptable range of uses." - Dara Bryant)

Being the best bootblack won't win you a title. Winning a title is a complex situation of being the right person at the right time in their life as well as the right time in the community and in this world. The fact of the matter is, I don't think my platform would have been nearly as powerful if Hillary had one the election. But people were feeling like we could use the Refuge. I had the right message for the right moment. Winning a title, yes even a Bootblack title, is about branding and timing.

Tabitha Arie Fischer talks a lot about how to win a title you must be more than "just a bootblack." And I think Tabitha is very wise.

If you are thinking about running for title, but you thinking to yourself: "I don't know if my skills are quite there." I'd encourage you to do it. Win or lose, you will learn a lot about yourself. I began this title journey in 2016 after only bootblacking in public for less than one year. (Albeit quite regularly at the eagle, which provided me more clientele in 6 months than some Bootblack's will get in a year.) I have learned so much about myself since I started publicly working a stand. It had been an invaluable experience.

I truly do believe in the title system and in its ability to not just make a positive difference in our community, but to make a positive difference in the lives of our titleholders.

#### You can do anything you set your mind to

Think about what you want to acomplish. And think about what it will take to reach your goals. Then apply yourself diligently to the task at hand. Move forward with passion and determination. You can do anything you set your mind to if you really apply yourself.

Thanks for reading this really long post.
